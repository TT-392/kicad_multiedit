# requirements and wishes
syntax or other error indicator with tooltip
tooltip varname
custom attributes, add, remove, lock name when applied
switch between python field, python box, and native field
different color when python field has been changed
retain python input in boxes even when the boxes aren't visible / active
of course the origin thing
leave box open and update, could be the same button as the update button

# far out wishes
tab completion
resizable box
saved setups
collapsable categories, but there is no way that is gonna be easy with wxpython


# input
layout:
- lib containing:
  - names, categories, varnames, and native field type

data: // updateable while gui open
      // missing fields should be made invisible
- lib with same names and categories as keys
  - value, as string interpretable by python


list of python terms for completion // only if this feature is added
list with strings


# output
data:
same as input data, but should only changed values
